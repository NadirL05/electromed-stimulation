typescript:
  - Always use strict typing
  - Avoid 'any' type unless absolutely necessary
  - Use type guards instead of type casting
  - Export all types from dedicated files

react:
  - Use functional components with TypeScript
  - Type all props interfaces
  - Use proper generics for hooks (useState<Type>, useForm<Type>)

workflow:
  - Run type-check before suggesting code
  - Suggest tests for new features
  - Warn about potential runtime errors
